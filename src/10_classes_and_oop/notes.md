# Javascript and classes

## OOP

- It is structure of writing a code
- Javascript is having objects

## Object

- Object is a collection of properties(variables) and methods(function)
  - example: promise, toLowerCase

## Why we need OOP

- We can have reusability, create services etc

## Parts of OOP

- Object literal {} : Object literal ka matlab hai ki hum directly ek object ko define karte hain bina kisi constructor function ya class ke.
- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)



## 4 Pillars

- Abstracction: Hide the internal details and give the abstraction
- Encapsulation: Wrap up the data so no one can access it, whatever we need methods we hide it.
- Inheritance:	
- Polymorphism: made up of 2 words, poly and morphism. 1 method will do many work
